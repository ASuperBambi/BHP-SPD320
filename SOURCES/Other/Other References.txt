	Which one of these teapots do I usually use? None of the above.I drink tea every morning. At an early hour,
	efficiency comes first. So, upon awakening, I pad into my kitchen and push the button on a Japanese hot pot
	to boil water while I spoon cut tea leaves into a little metal brewing ball. I drop the ball into my cup,
	fill it with boiling water, wait a few minutes for it to steep, and my tea is ready to drink. Fast, efficient,
	easy to clean.

	Robert Bocock defines the very ideology of consumerism as a vital sociocultural process,
	emerging primarily from a sense of lack: ‘Consumption is founded on a lack – a desire always for 
	something not there. Modern/post-modern consumers, therefore, will never be satisfied. The
	more they consume, the more they will desire to consume.’
- Bocock, R., Consumption, Routledge, London, 1993, p. 69.
